def convert_to_2d(position):
    """
    Convert a 3D part position to 2D.

    The negative of the depth (z) component of the 3D position becomes

    of the 2D position.

    Parameters
    ----------
    position : array_like
        3D position of body part.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        2D position.

    Calculate the distance between each consecutive pair of points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    points : array_like
        List of points.

    Yields
    ------

        Distance between two consecutive points.

    Examples

    Order points so they correspond to points from the previous frame.

    Only two points are allowed on each frame.

    The correspondence minimizes the total distance travelled by the points
    from the previous frame to the current.

    Parameters
    ----------
    points_prev, points_curr : ndarray
        Previous and current points.
        (2, d) array of 2 points with dimension d.

    Returns
    -------
    points_ordered : ndarray
        Current points in the order that corresponds to previous points.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        When either input does not have two rows.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> points_prev = np.array([[0, 0], [10, 11]])
